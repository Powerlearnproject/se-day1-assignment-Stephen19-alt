Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of enginering meethods, tools, and principles in designing, developing, deploying, and maintaing sofware systems/products. The importance of software engineering in technology industry is to create systems and applications critical for aspects of modern day to day life such as communication, healthcare, commerce, manufacturing, and entertainment. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the developemnt of programming lanuguages, the advent of structured programming in 1970s, and the emergence of agile methodologies. Progrmaming languages have evolved from low-level languages such assembly language where codes were in symbols to high-level procedural programming languages, such as FORTRAN and COBOL that improved code organisation and reusability, and productivity to modern programming languages, such as Python. Structured or modular programming languages was witnessed in the 1970s. It entails the development of programs with readable codes and reusable components. Agile methodologies that emerged in the 2000s values flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of software life cycle (SDLC) includes requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance. In the requirements phase, the software developer gathers and documents user needs and system requirements. During the design phase, the software developer creates high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface. The implementation phase entails writing codes and building the software based on design specifications. In the testing phase, the software deveop tests the software to ascertain whether it means quality standards and functional requirements. During the deployment phase, the softawre developer releases the software to the users and customers. The last phase called the maintenance phase involves providing daily support, updates, and enhancements of software after releasing it to the users and customers. 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile and waterfall methodologies have similarities and differences. Both are methodologies used in software development. Waterfall methodologies utilize linear and sequential approach consisting of several phases in the development of software. The phases include requirements, design, implementation, etc. The waterfall methodologies are useful in situations where the project requirements are well defined and the project goals are clear typical of large scale projects with long deadlines. In contrast, agile methodologies employ an iterative and incremental approach that focus on flexibility, collaboration, and response to change. Agile methodologies are useful in scenarios where there is need for collaboration, the requirements are bound to changes, and the development is done in short cycles. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software engineering requires a team-based approach. A software developer writes codes and implements software solutions. A quality assurance engineer designs and executes test plans to assess whether the programs or sytems meet the quality standards. A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The Integrated Development Environments are software engineering tools that combine the common activities of writing a software program into a single application which enables editing source codes, building executables, and debugging, for example, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA. Version Control Systems is a software development tool that makes it possible to manage changes made to the source code or files, for example, Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face many challenges. Firstly, the project's requirements may change in the course software development cycle causing scope creep and project delays. Secondly, software engineering may be required to deliver projects under tight deadlines leading to development of a rushed project that compromises the quality of product. Lastly, the tight deadlines may force software engineers to prioritize the delivery of programs over perfect code leading to technical debt that increases the maintenance cost. The software engineer can foster effective communication, prioritize tasks according to deadlines, continuossly reassess the goals and timelines of programs, and apply agile methodologies to overcome the challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is done to ensure that the program or system meet quality standards and needs of the users. Unit testing entails the testing of individual components or modules of a software. Integration testing tests the interactions between different subsystems and components. In system testing, one tests the system as a whole. Lastly acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure that it meets user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt enginer=ering focuses on crafting statements or questions to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering is important because it enables us to avoid vague questions that generate vague responses from AI models and instead ask clear and specific questions that enable AI models to generate relevant responses.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is "Write a mail to my colleague notifying them of the project's progress." An improved prompt would be: "Write an email to colleague Samuel notifying him that the project that first two phases of the software development were successful." The improved prompt specifies the recipient of the email and provides details to be included in the email.
